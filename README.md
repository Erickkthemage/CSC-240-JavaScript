# CSC 240 JavaScript I

## Collection of Projects

### Hands-On Project 1

This project was to create an ordered list by writing to the document using JavaScript.

### Hands-On Project 2

This page converts Farenheit to Celsius and back. It uses a named function to do the calculation, and it uses an anonymous function on a change to the input.

### Hands-On Project 3

This page uses a list with items that can be checked or unchecked, and it uses a for loop to add event listeners to each item on the list and a function to calculate the total price of the checked items in the list.

### Hands-On Project 4

This page uses a function to calculate the total moving cost determined by the weight of items being moved and the distance being moved. It also uses a try and catch statement to make sure the inputs are accepted values and displaying an error when the values are unacceptable.

### Hands-On Project 5

This is a math quiz that includes a start button which causes the questions to appear and start a timer and once the timer runs out it highlights the input forms that had incorrect answers. It then displays an alert message that contains the percentage of correct answers.

### Hands-On Project 6

This page prompts a user to create a username and password which is later displayed on the next page after submission. This was also my first time using regular expressions to create a pattern requirement for passwords.

### Hands-On Project 7

This is just another page similar to Project 6, in order to practice using more regular expressions.
